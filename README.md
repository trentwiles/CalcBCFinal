# AP Calculus BC Final Project

*This project is no longer updated. It is hosted on [integral.trentwil.es](integral.trentwil.es) as a legacy project.*

Tool that compares Integrals to Riemann Sums and the Midpoint Rule. This is the final project for my AP Calculus BC class in 2023. Enjoy. 

## Important Notes

~~Everything works great as of this update, but when the **lower** integral bounds are changed, the sum calculations in python go a bit haywire. I'm going to need to review my code to change this. If I can't fix it, I'll have to remove the option to change the lower integral bound.~~

## Upgrades

* ~~Change bounds of integral~~
* ~~Load in data on page load~~
* Vanish cache backend
